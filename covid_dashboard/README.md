# Covid_19_Dashboard-with-Dash
This is a Covid-19 Dashboard made with Python using Dash, Plotly, Pandas and Numpy. This is a real-time dashboard where users can see data visualization graphs like pie charts, sunburst charts, treemap, etc. 

1. covid_dashboard.py
This python file has the preprocessing code along with the dashboard code. This was the first Dashboard I created using DASH and Plotly so the code might look horrendous and the concept of splitting the code into different files wasn't something I was familiar with. 

2. helper.py
This python file contains all the custom helper functions that was created preprocessing as well as for reducing and generalizing the code.
