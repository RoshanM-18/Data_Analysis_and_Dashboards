# Covid_19_Dashboard-with-Dash
This is a Covid-19 Dashboard made with Python using Dash, Plotly, Pandas and Numpy. This is a real-time dashboard where users can see data visualization graphs like pie charts, sunburst charts, treemap, etc. 

1. covid_dashboard.py
This python file has the preprocessing code along with the dashboard code. Since, I am creating a dashboard for the first time I am not familiar with the concept of splitting the code into seperate
files and also, this is a Work in Progress as there are many bugs and changes yet to be made to the code. 

2. helper.py
This python file contains all the custom helper functions I created to help me for preprocessing as well as for reducing and generalizing the code.
